## ADOPT A KITTY

This project was based on a random prompt that was decided by the team. And that prompt was "cats." 

Adopt a Kitty also happens to be my first application built with React, Css, Material-UI and Google Maps Api.


## Project Status
On-going

#### Example:

This project is currently in development. Currently building out a feature to allow users to locate/mark stray cats they find on the streets.

## Reflection

This was a 3 week project built off a "cat" prompt. Project goals included using technologies I have recently learnt which included: 
  - React, react-router-dom, react hooks
  - Css, Material-UI
  - Google Maps API 
 
The goal of this project was simply to get my feet wet with the technologies I have been learning. The idea was to create an info page about adopting cats and a small feature of being able to mark on google maps if a stray cat is spotted.  

One of the main challenges I ran into was finding a reason to use React. Thinking back, this project might have been too simple to justify using react... there wasn't any real state management. In my next project, I would like to utilise React better and build something more fitting.
